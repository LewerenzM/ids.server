<h1>IDS Restful API</h1>

<h2>authorization</h2>
<p>
	Most operations require a sessionId from making a login call to
	ICAT. The sessionId is then used to check that the operation on the
	data is permitted by following the general rule that if you are allowed
	that access to the metadata then you are allowed the same access to the
	data.
</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p>
	In the case of an error the returned json will be of the form:
	{"code":"NotFoundException", "message":"One of the data files requested
	has been deleted"}. Clients should always check the status code and if
	status/100 is not 2 then an error has occurred.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
	The @GET calls can be tried on a web browser and curl can be used to
	make any of the calls. For example a url of the form:
	<kbd>https://example.com/ids/version</kbd> will return some text such
	as <samp>{"version":"2.0.0"}</samp>
